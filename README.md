**BFAST Explorer** is an exploratory tool desgined to allow easy and fast 
time series analysis from *Landsat Surface Reflectance* pixel data. This 
tool uses *Google Earth Engine (GEE) API* to access remote sensing data and
perform some preprocessing, such as cloud filtering.

After the data are downloaded, three change detection algorithms
(**bfastmonitor**, **bfast01** and **bfast**) can be applied to the time
series in order to investigate changes in the trend and/or seasonal
components over time.

If you encounter any bugs, please send a message to almeida.xan@gmail.com,
or create an issue on the GitHub page.
